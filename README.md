# Image to Pencil Sketch

## Assignment
Select an image in **RGB format** and use the **OpenCV Python library** to transform it so that it resembles a **pencil sketch**. :contentReference

### Tips
- Convert the RGB image to **grayscale** — this will turn the image into a classic black-and-white photo. :contentReference
- **Invert** the grayscale image — sometimes referred to as a negative image, useful for enhancing details. :contentReference
- Mix the grayscale image with the inverted **blurry** image — by dividing pixel values of the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image; the result should resemble a pencil sketch. :contentReference
- Experiment with other OpenCV transformations to improve the sketch effect. :contentReference

## Data Description
We are providing you with a **sample image of a dog**, but you can choose any colored image you want to complete this project. :contentReference

## Practicalities
Make sure that the solution **reflects your entire thought process** — how your code is structured and the reasoning behind your approach is more important than the final files.
