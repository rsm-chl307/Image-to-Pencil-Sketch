# Image to Pencil Sketch

## Assignment
Select an image in **RGB format** and use the **OpenCV Python library** to transform it so that it resembles a **pencil sketch**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### Tips
- Convert the RGB image to **grayscale** — this will turn the image into a classic black-and-white photo. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Invert** the grayscale image — sometimes referred to as a negative image, useful for enhancing details. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Mix the grayscale image with the inverted **blurry** image — by dividing pixel values of the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image; the result should resemble a pencil sketch. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Experiment with other OpenCV transformations to improve the sketch effect. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Data Description
We are providing you with a **sample image of a dog**, but you can choose any colored image you want to complete this project. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Practicalities
Make sure that the solution **reflects your entire thought process** — how your code is structured and the reasoning behind your approach is more important than the final files. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
